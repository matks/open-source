      <description>List of apps and integrations used in Slack Productboard  Description: Productboard is a product management tool, used by the PrestaShop Core&amp;rsquo;s product team to gather feedback, organize and prioritize features and improvements to build, and to follow their development. These feedback are grouped together to create &amp;ldquo;features ideas&amp;rdquo; that you can see at http://feedback.prestashop.com/. The Productboard app connects this Slack to the PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s Productboard.
It allows the product managers to transform a Slack message (and its comments) into a feedback &amp;ldquo;note&amp;rdquo; on productboard.</description>
