      <description>PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s release and support cycle The PrestaShop project follows the Semantic Versioning convention and alternates between major and minor releases.
Major versions Major versions (eg. 8.0.0, 9.0.0) are important milestones. These versions contain new features, bug fixes, and above all, backward-incompatible changes that can impact modules and themes.
 Release cycle: every 12â€“18 months. Support: bug fixes until the next minor release.  Example: v8.0 receives bug fixes until v8.1 is released.</description>
